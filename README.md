# Chef Introductory Workshop

Welcome to Opscode's Chef Introductory Workshop for Linux/Unix System
Administrators!

See PREREQ.md for prerequisites for this workshop.

This is the
[Chef Repository](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_repository.html)
for the Linux/Unix system administrator focused workshop. It contains
the cookbooks, roles and data bags required to set up the initial
system used in the hands on exercises.

Copy this repository to your local system, for example to
`~/chef-workshop-sysadmin`.

Create the directory `~/chef-workshop-sysadin/.chef` in this
directory. That is where your knife configuration, API private key for
your user and the API private key for your Hosted Chef organization
will be stored.
