Chef Introductory Workshop

This document describes the prerequisites that attendees should meet
to get the most out of the workshop.

# General Requirements

As this is a workshop for people who will be managing linux-based 
infrastructure components, attendees should be familiar with basic to 
intermediate system administration topics including the following:

* Command-line familiarity with Unix/Linux shells
* System resource concepts like package, service and user management
* Key-based authentication (e.g., RSA/SSH)
* Version control systems (e.g., Git, Mercurial, Subversion)

Attendees should have basic working knowledge with at least one third
generation programming language such as Perl, Python, Php or Ruby.

* Basic data structures (string, numbers, array, hash or language
  equivalent)
* Conditionals (if/unless, case)
* Loops (for/foreach, while, or language equivalent)

Knowledge of Ruby is helpful, but not required.

# Workstation Requirements

Attendees should bring a wifi-enabled laptop to the workshop. The
following operating systems have been tested as *workstation systems*
with the hands on exercises:

* Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04
* Mac OS X 10.7.3+
* Windows 7+

Other platforms and platform versions may work without modification.
Due to time constraints we will not be able to troubleshoot issues
with unlisted platforms.

Attendees should install the following required software before the 
workshop starts.

* SSH/SCP (OpenSSH, puTTY/WinSCP or equivalent)
* A programmer's text editior, if you don't already have one (Vi/Vim,
  Emacs, Sublime Text 2, etc.)

If Chef Client is not already installed, use [Opscode's Full Stack 
Chef installer](http://www.opscode.com/chef/install). This will also 
be covered during the introductory portion of the workshop.

Please download a copy of this repository and extract it on your 
workstation.

On Unix/Linux/OS X systems:

* C/C++ compiler, build environment (`build-essential`, Xcode, or
  platform equivalent).
